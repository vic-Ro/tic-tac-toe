# Project: Tic tac toe

This is a project for the Odin Project [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript]

Live demo: https://vicromerodev.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

Github repository: https://github.com/vicromerodev/tic-tac-toe/

The idea of the project was to build a Tic tac Toe game trying to have as little global code as possible.

I implemented two games modes: one vs AI and another for two players. The AI moves use the minimax algorithm, so it's impossible to beat it (you can only draw).

I spent around 16h in the project. 

# Room for improvement

- Improve names validation with JS.
- Visual design.
- Refactorize code.
